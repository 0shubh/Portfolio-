# Portfolio Website

## Need

This project is a small personal portfolio website intended to showcase web development work and provide a simple, fast landing page. It exists so you can:

- Present projects and links in a lightweight, easy-to-deploy format.
- Demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills without extra build tooling.
- Serve as a starter template for a personal site or portfolio.

## Features

- Single-page structure using `index.html`.
- Styling in `style.css` and behavior in `script.js`.
- Minimal, dependency-free setup for quick edits and deployment.

## File structure

- [index.html](index.html) — main page and markup
- [style.css](style.css) — site styles
- [script.js](script.js) — interactive behaviors

## Usage

1. Open the project folder in your file explorer or a code editor.
2. To preview locally, open [index.html](index.html) in any modern browser.

Optional (serve with a local server):

Windows (PowerShell) using Python 3 installed:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Development

- Edit content in [index.html](index.html).
- Update styles in [style.css](style.css).
- Add or modify interactivity in [script.js](script.js).
- No build step required — changes are visible by reloading the page in the browser.

## Deploy

Because this is a static site, it can be deployed to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting service by pushing the files to the hosting source.

## License

Use as you like; add a license file if you need formal terms.
